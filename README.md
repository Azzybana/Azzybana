## Azzybana Raccoon's Trash

### About yours truly...
I started on a Commodore 64. I always prefer no-std, even on desktop Rust. I spent the majority of my life being 'the friend' who could show up, fix anything, and get you back in the game. Software, hardware, household appliances... it really didn't matter. My skills fall in electrical, computer, and nuclear engineering, on the tech side. I gave up on tech. Being able to do things, and remembering to do them consistently are two different things. We all have our faults, I was good enough, well, I don't make due anymore. 

I'm back in for Psychology now. New direction in life. While I have every intention of working towards being able to help others with issues like mine, who don't really get a fair shake with current treatment protocols, I still dabble. Some of that dabbling may lead to quantifying data points, that I need to gather, from a variety of networked resources. I'm sure you can see where old skillsets may align with new ones I'm developing. 

Hoping something I do helps others.
